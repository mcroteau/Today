    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="left">Dynamics +Gain was founded by me, Mike.
    Yeah, I admit it, I've been homeless. You
    know what the worst part about it is, most people
    don't give a poop. That's where we come in.
    We are aware of the problem of
    disparity and offer a portal for you to donate.
    In addition, we find a whole bunch of
    people who care and allow you to give them money as well.
    Dynamic +Gain is a gateway to all the
    organizations we can find that act on the
    behalf of others and allow you to invest in
        them!</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="left">100% of your donation goes toward the organization you select
    or to Dynamics <strong>+Gain</strong>.
        The organization has signed up and
    has gone through the registration process.</p>


    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Give me details, how did you make this work?!</h3>
    <p class="left">Dynamics +Gain uses Stripe to process donations.
        You will need to setup a Stripe account in order to
        move forward. They are inexpensive and worth it,
        I make no money from them. Period.
        Stripe is a pay as you go service so
        nothing is charged unless a donation is made to you,
        then its cents on the dollar.
    </p>

    <p class="center">Here is the exact amount:</p>
    <h4 style="display:inline-block">2.9% + 30&cent; per charge</h4>

    <p class="center">so</p>
    <p class="center">$10 donation would cost 59&cent;</p>

    <p class="left highlight">Again, we make nothing from a transaction! Just satisfaction that we
        may be helping people who are helping people! We hope you enjoy!</p>


    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">What's up with the name?</h3>
    <p class="left">Well, I recalled what it felt like to be without.
        It was pretty disheartening. Calling someone Dynamic is a
        pretty big compliment, so they, the people in need are...
        Dynamics <strong>+Gain</strong>.

    <p>Thank you.</p>
