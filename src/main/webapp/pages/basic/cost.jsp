    <h1>Cost</h1>

    <p class="left">We are just starting out so everything is still being ironed out,
        but as of right now <strong class="highlight">1 booth/kiosk stand costs $500</strong> with an
        non-discounted rate of <strong class="highlight">$20 a month</strong> internet cost per
        stand.</p>

    <p class="left" style="margin-top:20px;">Right now we have <strong class="highlight">0</strong>
    stands setup and configured, with a goal of these stands being setup &amp;
    configured as many places as possible, the operating cost will be a little steep but worth it.
    Information is power, and we are offering the ability to inform
        people in order for them to help their local community.</p>

    <p class="left" style="margin-top:20px;">Administrative costs outside of that are practically zero.
    The individual, me responsible for everything Dynamics <strong>+Gain</strong>
    wants to see this to the end.</p>
